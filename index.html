            That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love,
            everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who
            ever was, lived out their lives.<br><br>The aggregate of our joy and
            suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and
            economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,
            every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant,
            every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child,
            inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt
            politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint
            and sinner in the history of our species lived there.</p><p class="quote"> The Earth is a
            very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of
            blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory
            and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction
            of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants
            of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable
            inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their
            misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how
            fervent their hatreds.</p> <p class="quote">Our posturings, our imagined self-importance,
              the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe,
              are challenged by this haven, hanging alone in the void. Our planet is a lonely
              speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all
              this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere
              to save us from ourselves. </p> <p class="quote">The Earth is the only world known so far
                to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future,
                to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet.
                Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
                It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
                experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of
                human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it
                underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another,
                and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've
                ever known.</p>

<!-- We who cannot even put our planetary home in order. Riven with
            rivalries and hatreds despoiling our environments, murdering one
            another through irritatin and inattention as well as on deadly
            purpose and moreover a species that until only revently was
            convinced that the whole universe was made for its sole benefit. I
            do not imagine that it is precisely we with our present customs and
            social conventions who will be our there. If we continue to
            accumulate only power and not wisdom we will surely destroy
            ourselves. Our very existence in that disant time requires that we
            will have changed our institutions, and ourselves. How can I dare to
            guess about humans in the far future. It is I htink only a matter of
            natural selection. If we become even slightly more violent,
            short-sighted, ignorant and selfish than we are now, almost
            certainly, we will have no future. -->
